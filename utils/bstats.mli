(** Reset all the timings *)
val reset : unit -> unit 

(** Time a function and associate the time with the given string. If some
    timing information is already associated with that string, then accumulate
    the times. If this function is invoked within another timed function then
    you can have a hierarchy of timings *)
val time : string -> ('a -> 'b) -> 'a -> 'b 


(** Print the current stats preceeded by a message *)
val print : out_channel -> string -> unit
